Mental illnesses in BiH are constantly on the rise and represent a serious problem, not only because of their frequency but also because their consequences are much more severe for those affected. In recent years, the number of people in our country suffering from PTSD, neuroses, phobias, and schizophrenia has increased.",
    "aboutParagraph2": "The fast-paced lifestyle, unpredictable changes in the world and society, unstable business environments, and social media pressure additionally affect the psyche of BiH citizens. Balance has become necessary for harmonizing our physical, emotional, mental, and spiritual needs. Without it, we often lose direction and feel exhausted, irritable, and insecure.",
    "aboutParagraph3": "Although it plays an increasingly important role and is in the focus of all target groups, life BALANCE in BiH still does not receive enough attention. There is no public dialogue or event that encompasses all aspects necessary for a balanced life.",
